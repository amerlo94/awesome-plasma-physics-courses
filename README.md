## Nuclear Fusion

- [Introduction to Fusion Energy and Plasma Physics](https://suli.pppl.gov/2020/course/index.html) - Princeton (2020).
	- The Summer Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) course is a summer school regularly given at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). It consists of a series of lectures ranging from an introductory level into plasma physics and nuclear fusion to specialized talks about turbulence in plasmas, plasma propulsion, and complex plasmas, to give just a few examples.
- [Fusion Research](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9F2aQG5CnOdw9MXqS309tojBUvChQ9jm) - Stuttgart (2020).
	- General introduction to nuclear fusion.
- [Plasma and Fusion Energy Physics](http://hdl.handle.net/2128/9939) - KU Leuven (2015).
	- The Carolus Magnus Summer School aims at graduate and postgraduate students active in or becoming active in controlled thermonuclear fusion. Lecture notes are available [here](https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/283582/files/Energie_Umwelt_298.pdf?version=1).

## MHD

- [22.615, MHD Theory of Fusion Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-615-mhd-theory-of-fusion-systems-spring-2007/) - MIT (2007).
	- This course discusses MHD equilibria in cylindrical, toroidal, and noncircular tokamaks. It covers derivation of the basic MHD model from the Boltzmann equation, use of MHD equilibrium theory in poloidal field design, MHD stability theory including the Energy Principle, interchange instability, ballooning modes, second region of stability, and external kink modes. Emphasis is on discovering configurations capable of achieving good confinement at high beta.
- [MA5902, A mathematical introduction to Magnetohydrodynamics](https://www-m16.ma.tum.de/Allgemeines/MHD19) - TUM (2019).
	- The course provides a basic introduction to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), with emphasis on its mathematical aspects (as opposite to physical phenomena). Essentially, MHD is the theory of electrically conducting fluids in presence of a magnetic field. Since MHD is one of the two building blocks (together with kinetic theory) of theoretical plasma physics, its understanding is of paramount importance for applied mathematicians who deal with plasma physics and nuclear fusion applications.
- [Advanced Fluid Dynamics](http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/AdvFD/) - Oxford (2020).
	- Part I: MHD equations: conservation laws in a conducting fluid; Maxwell stress/magnetic forces; induction equation; Lundquist theorem, flux freezing, amplification of magnetic field. MHD in a strong guide field: MHD waves; high-beta and anisotropic limits and orderings; incompressible MHD, Elsasser MHD, Reduced MHD. Static MHD equilibria, force-free solutions, helicity, Taylor relaxation. Energy principle. Instabilities: interchange, Z-pinch.
	- Part II: Fluid mechanics with general extra stress. Dilute suspension of spheres: Einstein viscosity. Dilute suspension of beads on springs: Oldroyd-B model for polymeric liquids, elastic waves, anisotropic pressure. Dilute suspension of orientable particles (ellipsoids): road map to liquid crystals, swimmers and active matter.
- [Plasma Fluid Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJnw7q_gjMgmuGctIqL6crS7cmmALTZLe) - National Research Foundation of Korea (2019).
	- This course requires basic undergraduate physics knowledge and starts with simple fluid mechanics, going then into a wide range of topics including 2-fluid treatment, magnetohydroynamics (MHD), and more. Lecture notes are available [here](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~bd512/teaching/plasma-fluid-theory.html).

## Transport

- [22.616, Plasma Transport Theory](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-616-plasma-transport-theory-fall-2003/) - MIT (2003).
	- This course describes the processes by which mass, momentum, and energy are transported in plasmas, with special reference to magnetic confinement fusion applications. The Fokker-Planck collision operator and its limiting forms, as well as collisional relaxation and equilibrium, are considered in detail. Special applications include a Lorentz gas, Brownian motion, alpha particles, and runaway electrons. The Braginskii formulation of classical collisional transport in general geometry based on the Fokker-Planck equation is presented. Neoclassical transport in tokamaks, which is sensitive to the details of the magnetic geometry, is considered in the high (Pfirsch-Schluter), low (banana) and intermediate (plateau) regimes of collisionality.

## Waves
